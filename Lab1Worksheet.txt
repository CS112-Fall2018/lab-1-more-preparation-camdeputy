Lab 1 Worksheet

1. What if 12 bits were used to store a signed integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer?
	2048

2. Think about possible values and their range, say what type of variable would be suitable for the following, and suggest a name for it too. 
	
For example: the temperature of a room in degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature is likely to vary between say 50 degrees F and 100 degrees F,  but it can take any value in between including non-integers, e.g 71.19 F, so the type must be float or double depending on the accuracy required. A suitable variable name would be roomTemp. 


(i) The number of pages in a book; 
	int numPages

(ii) The number of atoms in a book; 
	int numAtoms

(iii) The length of a side of a triangle in inches; 
	double triLength

(iv) Your name; 
	String name

(v) Whether or not a nucleus has decayed; 
	boolean nuclDecayed

(vi) The probability that it could have decayed. 
	double nuclDecayed

3. Start to do a little java programming! 
	Follow the example of the Hello.java program and do some testing of Java int and float.
	Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following:

		Creates 4 local variables
			Two ints (call them a and b)
			Two floats (call them x and y)
		Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of two of these 
		and output using System.out.println each of the results
			Addition
			Division (in both directions)

public class Arithmetic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 2;
		int b = 3;
		float x = .1438f;
		float y = .7690f;
		System.out.println(a + b);
		System.out.println(a + x);
		System.out.println(a + y);
		System.out.println(b + x);
		System.out.println(b + y);
		System.out.println(x + y);
		System.out.println(a/b);
		System.out.println(a/x);
		System.out.println(a/y);
		System.out.println(b/x);
		System.out.println(b/y);
		System.out.println(x/y);
		System.out.println(y/x);
		System.out.println(y/b);
		System.out.println(y/a);
		System.out.println(x/b);
		System.out.println(x/a);
		System.out.println(b/a);
	}
}
